## Lessons Learned

Automation with the Puppeteer library is kind of easy, but when I tried to handle queries for multiple users, it became really difficult to manage. 

However, I found a solution that helped me a lot.

I used a single browser with a global variable so that every query is searched in one browser, which avoids opening many browsers, and closes every page after execution

req.resourceType() === 'image' || // block images
                req.resourceType() === 'stylesheet' || // block stylesheets
                req.resourceType() === 'font' || // block fonts
                req.resourceType() === 'script' // block scripts


This helps me to execute more faster.
